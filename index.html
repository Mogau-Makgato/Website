                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>My name is Mogau Makgato, born in Limpopo and was raised in and completed his primary and seconadary schooling in Gauteng, Pretoria. 
                <p>I completed my Diploma in Fine Arts studies in 2016, at the University of Durban Technology.
                  Im a gamer and streamer in my spare time, I have always been intrueged on how games are developed, back end and front. Ive always enjoyed creating and solving problem in my Arts, and ever since I joined Hyperion Development to study Software Engineering, 
                  I transitioned and engaged in the art of creating and solving problems in code.</p> 
                <p>As a software Engineer residing in Gauteng, to be apart of the 4th industrial Revolution means that you have to adapt and get involved in Technology, there
                  is always new tech being released and I can not miss out on, thus I decided to complete my qualification in 'Software Engineering' and get involved.
                  The future is evolving to be more technological.</p>
